            <h1>Neonatology</h1>
            <p>Neonatology is a specialized field of medicine focusing on the care of newborns, especially those who are premature or have complex health issues. This branch of pediatrics deals with the medical needs of infants during the first 28 days of life, ensuring their health and development. Neonatologists work in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), providing advanced care to the most vulnerable patients.</p>
