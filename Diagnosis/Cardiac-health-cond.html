            <h2>Heart and Brain</h2>
            <p>Poor heart health can lead to strokes due to reduced blood flow to the brain. Conditions like atrial fibrillation increase the risk of clots traveling to the brain, causing cognitive decline and memory loss. In severe cases, chronic heart disease may contribute to vascular dementia.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Lungs</h2>
            <p>Heart failure can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, leading to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Pulmonary hypertension can increase pressure in the lungs, straining the heart. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease often coexist, worsening respiratory function.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Kidneys</h2>
            <p>Poor circulation due to heart disease can damage the kidneys, leading to chronic kidney disease. High blood pressure and heart failure often result in reduced kidney function over time. Severe cases may require dialysis due to kidney failure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Liver</h2>
            <p>Congestive heart failure can cause blood to back up in the liver, leading to liver congestion and damage. This can result in swelling, jaundice, and reduced liver function. Over time, it may contribute to conditions like cirrhosis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Digestive System</h2>
            <p>Poor blood circulation due to heart disease can cause digestive issues, including nausea, loss of appetite, and fluid buildup in the abdomen. Reduced blood flow to the intestines may lead to ischemic bowel disease, causing severe pain and digestive complications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Extremities</h2>
            <p>Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs when narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the legs and arms, causing pain, weakness, and an increased risk of infections and slow-healing wounds. Severe PAD can lead to amputation in extreme cases.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Skin</h2>
            <p>Poor circulation due to heart disease can cause changes in skin color, cold extremities, and slow wound healing. Some conditions, like infective endocarditis, can cause skin lesions or rashes due to bacterial infection in the heart valves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heart and Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Cardiac conditions can impact mental health, leading to increased anxiety and depression. The stress of managing heart disease can contribute to emotional distress and cognitive decline. Studies show a strong connection between heart disease and increased risk of developing depression.</p>
