            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urinary health plays a crucial role in overall well-being. Poor urinary function can result in several complications affecting different parts of the body, including the kidneys, bladder, and even the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Proper hydration and hygiene are essential in preventing these conditions.</p>

            <h2>Health Conditions in Different Body Parts Due to Urine Issues</h2>
            <h3>Kidneys</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):</strong> Poor urine filtration leads to toxin buildup in the body, causing kidney failure over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> Hard deposits of minerals and salts form due to inadequate hydration, causing severe pain and blockages.</li>
                <li><strong>Nephritis:</strong> Inflammation of the kidneys due to infections or autoimmune disorders, leading to reduced kidney function.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Bladder</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Bacterial infections cause burning sensations, frequent urination, and pelvic pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Bladder Cancer:</strong> Long-term exposure to harmful substances in urine can lead to abnormal cell growth in the bladder lining.</li>
                <li><strong>Overactive Bladder (OAB):</strong> Frequent urination due to involuntary bladder contractions, often causing urgency and incontinence.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Liver</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hepatic Encephalopathy:</strong> Toxin accumulation in the blood due to impaired urine excretion can lead to confusion, tremors, and unconsciousness.</li>
                <li><strong>Jaundice:</strong> Dark urine caused by excess bilirubin can indicate severe liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Cardiovascular System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):</strong> Kidney dysfunction leads to fluid imbalance, increasing blood pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrolyte Imbalances:</strong> Poor urine excretion affects sodium, potassium, and calcium levels, impacting heart function.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Nervous System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> Toxin buildup in the blood from kidney failure can damage nerves, leading to numbness and weakness.</li>
                <li><strong>Seizures:</strong> Severe electrolyte imbalances due to urine problems can lead to neurological disturbances, including seizures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Urinary Health Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate water intake leading to concentrated urine.</li>
                <li>Poor hygiene increasing the risk of bacterial infections.</li>
                <li>High sugar intake, contributing to diabetes and kidney damage.</li>
                <li>Long-term medication use affecting kidney function.</li>
                <li>Genetic predisposition to kidney and bladder diseases.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Preventive Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain adequate hydration by drinking at least 8 glasses of water daily.</li>
                <li>Practice proper hygiene to prevent infections.</li>
                <li>Limit intake of processed and high-sodium foods.</li>
                <li>Monitor urine color, frequency, and consistency.</li>
                <li>Schedule regular urine tests to detect health issues early.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>When to Seek Medical Help</h2>
            <p>If you experience persistent pain during urination, blood in urine, excessive or infrequent urination, or any significant changes in urine color, consult a healthcare provider immediately. Timely diagnosis can prevent serious complications.</p>
