            <h2>Radiation Exposure Risks</h2>
            <p>Repeated exposure to X-rays and CT scans can slightly increase the risk of cancer, especially in children and those with high cumulative radiation exposure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Contrast Dye Reactions</h2>
            <p>Some imaging tests use contrast dyes that may cause allergic reactions, kidney damage, or rare severe side effects in certain patients. Those with kidney disease or iodine allergies should consult their doctor before undergoing such tests.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Claustrophobia and Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Patients undergoing MRI scans in enclosed spaces may experience claustrophobia, anxiety, or panic attacks due to the confined environment. Open MRI options or sedation may be considered for such patients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pregnancy-Related Risks</h2>
            <p>Radiation exposure from imaging tests can pose potential risks to developing fetuses. Pregnant women should consult their doctor before undergoing X-rays, CT scans, or nuclear imaging tests to determine safer alternatives like ultrasound or MRI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Kidney Complications</h2>
            <p>Patients with pre-existing kidney disease may experience worsening kidney function after receiving contrast dyes used in CT and MRI scans. Doctors may recommend hydration or alternative imaging methods to reduce this risk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Skin Burns from Radiation Therapy</h2>
            <p>Excessive exposure to high-dose radiation in certain treatments can lead to skin burns, tissue damage, or long-term effects on organs. Proper shielding and adherence to safety protocols help minimize these risks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>False Positives and Unnecessary Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Imaging tests may sometimes detect abnormalities that are benign or clinically insignificant, leading to unnecessary stress, further tests, and even invasive procedures. Proper medical evaluation is necessary to interpret results accurately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Misdiagnosis and Overuse</h2>
            <p>Over-reliance on imaging can sometimes lead to misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or delayed accurate diagnosis. Imaging should be used in combination with clinical evaluation and other diagnostic tests for accurate medical decisions.</p>
