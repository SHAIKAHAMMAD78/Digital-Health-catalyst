            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Urine health plays a crucial role in detecting various medical conditions. Abnormalities in urine composition can indicate infections, kidney diseases, diabetes, and other severe health risks. Regular urine testing is essential for early diagnosis and prevention of serious health complications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Common Health Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):</strong> Bacterial infections causing pain, burning sensation, and frequent urination. If left untreated, UTIs can spread to the kidneys, causing severe complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Kidney Stones:</strong> Hard mineral deposits in the urinary tract leading to severe pain and blockages. Kidney stones may require medical intervention if they become too large to pass naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> High glucose levels in urine can be an early indicator of diabetes. Consistently high sugar levels can lead to diabetic kidney disease and other complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Dark and concentrated urine may suggest dehydration, which can result in kidney damage, electrolyte imbalance, and increased risk of infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Proteinuria:</strong> Excess protein in urine is a sign of kidney disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Persistent proteinuria may indicate chronic kidney failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Liver Disease:</strong> Dark-colored urine, along with yellowish skin or eyes, can be linked to liver conditions like hepatitis, cirrhosis, and jaundice.</li>
                <li><strong>Hematuria (Blood in Urine):</strong> Presence of blood in urine may indicate kidney infections, bladder cancer, or severe urinary tract damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Bladder Cancer:</strong> Persistent blood in urine and changes in urination patterns can be early warning signs of bladder cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Interstitial Cystitis:</strong> A chronic bladder condition that leads to frequent urination, pelvic pain, and discomfort without any infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrolyte Imbalance:</strong> Abnormal urine pH and electrolyte levels can disrupt nerve function, muscle control, and hydration balance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Urine-Related Health Issues</h2>
            <p>Several factors contribute to urine-related health conditions, including poor hydration, bacterial infections, metabolic disorders, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle choices. Consumption of excessive alcohol, processed foods, and high-sodium diets can negatively impact urine health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Preventive Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink plenty of water to maintain optimal hydration and flush out toxins.</li>
                <li>Maintain proper hygiene to prevent bacterial infections.</li>
                <li>Limit sugar and salt intake to protect kidney function.</li>
                <li>Monitor urine color, odor, and frequency for early detection of health issues.</li>
                <li>Undergo routine medical check-ups and urine tests to identify underlying health conditions.</li>
                <li>Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can harm kidney and liver function.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>When to Seek Medical Attention</h2>
            <p>If you experience persistent symptoms such as frequent urination, pain while urinating, dark or bloody urine, or unexplained fatigue, consult a doctor immediately. Early diagnosis can help in effective treatment and prevent serious complications.</p>
